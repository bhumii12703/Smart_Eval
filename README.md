# 🤖 SmartEval: AI-Powered Evaluation System

SmartEval is a comprehensive, AI-powered application built with Streamlit designed to automate the evaluation of student answer sheets. It provides a full-circle workflow, from PDF upload and AI-driven grading to detailed analytics dashboards for both teachers and students.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🧑‍🏫 For Teachers & Admins

  * **Global Dashboard:** View class-wide analytics, including the number of papers evaluated, pending papers, completion percentage, and average class scores.
  * **AI Evaluation Workflow:** Upload a Question Paper, Answer Key, and a Student's Answer Sheet (all as PDFs) to start the grading process.
  * **Automated OCR & Grading:** The system automatically extracts text from all PDFs, detects diagrams, and uses a Google AI API Key to grade the student's paper against the answer key.
  * **Detailed Analytics:** Receive a detailed, question-by-question breakdown of the student's performance, including section-wise charts and overall scorecards.
  * **Feedback Hub:** Review all feedback submitted by both students and teachers in a centralized location.
  * **Secure Authentication:** Register and log in with a secure, password-hashed account.

### 🧑‍🎓 For Students

  * **Secure Login:** Students log in using their unique USN (University Serial Number) to access their results.
  * **Instant Reports:** View a detailed evaluation report, including total marks, pass/fail status, and a personalized feedback summary generated by the AI.
  * **Performance Insights:** See your own analytics, including score breakdowns and charts, to understand your strengths and weaknesses.
  * **Submit Feedback:** Provide feedback on your evaluation, which helps teachers improve the grading process.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8+
  * **Poppler:** This is a crucial external dependency required for converting PDFs to images.
      * **Windows:** Download from [a Poppler for Windows build](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/) and add the `bin/` directory to your system's PATH.
      * **macOS (Homebrew):** `brew install poppler`
      * **Linux (apt):** `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils`

### 2\. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url/SmartEval.git
cd SmartEval
```

### 3\. Setup Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4\. Install Dependencies

Create a file named `requirements.txt` in your project folder with the following content:

**`requirements.txt`**

```
streamlit
pandas
plotly
pdf2image
```

Then, install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5\. Create Directory Structure

The application requires a specific folder structure to save and read files.

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
mkdir -p data outputs/scores outputs/diagram_temp assets

# On Windows (PowerShell)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "data", "outputs/scores", "outputs/diagram_temp", "assets"
```

### 6\. Create Core Data Files

Create the following empty files inside the `data/` directory. The app needs these to exist.

  * `data/users.json`: Stores teacher/admin login info.
    ```json
    {}
    ```
  * `data/students.json`: Stores the master list of valid student USNs.
    ```json
    [
      "1AB19CS001",
      "1AB19CS002"
    ]
    ```
  * `data/feedback.json`: Stores all submitted feedback.
    ```json
    []
    ```

### 7\. Add Assets

Place your logo files inside the `assets/` folder. The app specifically looks for:

  * `assets/logo.mp4`
  * `assets/logo.png`

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

With your virtual environment activated and dependencies installed, run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
