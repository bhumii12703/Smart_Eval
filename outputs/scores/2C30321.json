  "evaluation_report": "## Student Evaluation Report\n\nThis is an excellent performance demonstrating a high level of understanding across both modules. Your answers are well-structured, technically accurate, and supported by relevant details and diagrams. You achieved full marks in Module 2 (Inter-Process Communication and Multi-threading models) and nearly full marks in Module 1.\n\nDiagrams were used effectively to support explanations. You provided clear representations for OS services, IPC models, and threading models, which significantly enhanced the clarity of your answers.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   **Conceptual Mastery:** Demonstrated a strong grasp of core OS concepts, achieving full marks in Module 2 (IPC and Multi-threading).\n*   **Detailed Knowledge:** Provided advanced details in Q3a (Message Passing), including Naming, Synchronization, and Buffering methods, which shows comprehensive preparation.\n*   **Effective Use of Diagrams:** Successfully integrated diagrams/representations for OS services, Shared Memory, Message Passing, and all three Multi-threading models, enhancing communication clarity.\n*   **Clear Distinctions:** The comparison between Multiprogramming and Multitasking was precise and accurate, focusing on user interaction and system goals.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n*   **Precision in Distinctions:** Review the specific technical differences between Multi-processor and Clustered systems, focusing on resource sharing (Multi-processor systems typically share memory and I/O via a bus, whereas clustered systems use independent resources connected via a network). Your comparison of network types was slightly inaccurate.\n*   **Process State Definitions:** Ensure absolute clarity on the definitions of process states. In the quiz, you incorrectly identified the Ready state. Remember: the Ready state means the process is waiting only for the CPU, not blocked waiting for an event or I/O completion.",
