  "evaluation_report": "## Evaluation Report\n\n**Summary:** The student demonstrated an excellent grasp of the foundational concepts of Operating Systems covered in this section of the examination. Following the lenient grading philosophy, full credit is awarded for all attempted questions, indicating a strong conceptual understanding of OS definitions, services, and system architectures.\n\n**Diagram Performance:** The student successfully included the necessary diagram illustrating Operating System services (Q1.a). Furthermore, the detection tool suggests the student included two additional diagrams, indicating a good practice of using visual aids to support explanations, particularly in comparison-based questions.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   **Comprehensive Knowledge:** Demonstrated a clear understanding of the definition and dual roles (User vs. System Efficiency) of Operating System services.\n*   **Architectural Clarity:** Successfully differentiated between complex system architectures, specifically Multi-processor and Clustered systems.\n*   **Conceptual Distinction:** Clearly articulated the differences between Multiprogramming (focused on CPU utilization) and Multitasking (focused on responsiveness/time-sharing).\n*   **Effective Use of Diagrams:** Used diagrams effectively to illustrate complex concepts.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n*   Ensure all comparative answers (like Q1.b) are presented in a clear, tabular format to maximize clarity and precision, which aids in quick evaluation and ensures all comparison points are explicitly covered.\n*   While the core concepts are strong, practice articulating the specific technical terminology (keywords) used in the official definitions to ensure maximum score retention in stricter grading environments.",
