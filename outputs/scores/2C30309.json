  "evaluation_report": "## Student Evaluation Report\n\nThis report provides feedback on your performance in Test-01 for the Operating Systems course.\n\nOverall, your performance was moderate, demonstrating strong computational skills in CPU scheduling but requiring improvement in foundational theoretical concepts and definitions. You successfully attempted questions worth 23 marks.\n\nYour ability to construct and calculate metrics for FCFS, SRTF, and Preemptive Priority scheduling algorithms was excellent. However, there were significant conceptual gaps in defining system call types and distinguishing between processes and threads.\n\nYou included 4 detailed Gantt charts in your answer sheet, which were essential for solving the scheduling problems accurately.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   **CPU Scheduling Mastery:** You demonstrated excellent command over FCFS, SRTF, and Preemptive Priority scheduling algorithms, achieving correct Gantt charts, Turnaround Times (TAT), and Waiting Times (WT) for these three methods.\n*   **System Call Types (Core):** Your explanations for File Management and Process Control system calls were detailed and accurate.\n*   **Structured Calculation:** Your presentation of scheduling calculations (listing CT, TAT, WT, and averages) was clear and easy to follow.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n*   **Round Robin (RR) Logic:** The Gantt chart constructed for the Round Robin algorithm was fundamentally flawed, violating the quantum rule (q=2ms) by running processes for extended, non-preemptive durations. Review the mechanism of time slicing carefully.\n*   **Conceptual Definitions:** Your distinction between a Process and a Thread was incorrect, failing to address key differences like resource sharing (address space) and weight. Ensure you understand why threads are considered \"lightweight.\"\n*   **System Call Types (Advanced):** The explanations for Communication and Protection system calls were either too vague or conceptually incorrect (e.g., confusing Protection with error detection). Focus on the core function of these calls (e.g., Protection controls resource access).\n*   **Quiz Fundamentals:** Review basic OS concepts related to process states (Ready state) and the components involved in process execution (Program Counter).",
