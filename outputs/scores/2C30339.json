  "evaluation_report": "## Student Evaluation Report\n\nThis report provides feedback on your performance in Test-01 for the Operating Systems course (BCS303).\n\n**Summary:**\nYou demonstrated a strong understanding of the concepts covered in Question 2(b) regarding System Calls. The answer provided a clear list and detailed explanations for five out of the six major categories of system calls. The conceptual definitions provided were accurate, indicating solid foundational knowledge in Module 1. However, the overall score is limited due to the low number of questions attempted across the paper.\n\n**Diagram Performance:**\nThe specific question you attempted (Q2b) did not require a diagram. The automated analysis suggests that up to 5 diagrams may have been included elsewhere in the answer sheet. If these diagrams relate to other questions (like Virtual Machines or IPC models), ensure that the corresponding textual explanations are also provided to earn credit for those concepts.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Conceptual Clarity:** You clearly understand the purpose of system calls and their role in accessing OS services.\n*   **Detailed Explanations:** The explanations for Process Control, Device Management, and Information Management were particularly detailed and accurate, covering key functions like device connectivity and attribute management.\n*   **Structure:** The answer was well-structured, listing the types before explaining them individually.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n*   **Completeness:** Ensure all sub-parts of the attempted question are fully addressed. The explanation for the 'Protection' category of system calls was listed but the detailed explanation was missing.\n*   **Attempting Full Paper:** Only one question (Q2b) was attempted from Module 1, and no questions were attempted from Module 2 or the Quiz section. To maximize marks, it is crucial to attempt at least one full question from every required module.\n*   **Definition Precision:** While conceptually correct, strive for more precise, textbook definitions, especially for introductory terms like 'System Calls' (e.g., defining them as the interface between a process and the OS).",
