    "evaluation_report": "## Student Evaluation Report\n\n### Summary of Performance\n\nThe student demonstrated a strong foundational understanding of Operating System concepts, particularly in defining the OS and its services, and in applying scheduling algorithms. Performance in the theoretical sections was generally good, although there were some key conceptual confusions, notably distinguishing between multiprocessing and multitasking. The student performed well in the computational section (Q4), successfully solving three out of four scheduling problems, despite a major error in the SRTF implementation.\n\nThe student attempted all required diagrams/charts (5 elements found), including the four Gantt charts and a representation of OS services. While the Gantt charts for FCFS and Priority were accurate, the structural diagram for OS services was missing, and the SRTF chart was conceptually incorrect.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   **Conceptual Clarity (Q1a & Q1b i):** Provided an accurate definition of the OS and clearly distinguished between Multi-processor and Clustered systems, covering key differences like interconnection and scalability.\n*   **Scheduling Accuracy:** Successfully calculated Average Waiting Time and Average Turnaround Time for FCFS, Round Robin (RR), and Preemptive Priority algorithms, demonstrating strong application skills in these areas.\n*   **Process vs. Thread Distinction:** Provided excellent differentiating points regarding weight, resource usage, and dependency.\n*   **Quiz Performance:** Scored highly on the objective questions, indicating good recall of fundamental OS terminology (IPC, Process States, Program Counter).\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n*   **Diagrammatic Representation (Q1a):** The student must practice drawing the standard structural diagrams required by the syllabus, such as the layered view of OS services, rather than just listing the services.\n*   **SRTF Implementation:** The logic for Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) needs significant review. The student failed to implement the initial preemption at time 1 and incorrectly determined the sequence, leading to zero marks for this sub-part.\n*   **Conceptual Differentiation (Q1b ii):** There is a confusion between Multitasking (rapid context switching on a single CPU for responsiveness) and Multiprocessing (using multiple CPUs). This distinction must be clarified to avoid mixing up the goals and mechanisms of these two concepts.\n*   **Arithmetic Precision:** A minor arithmetic error was noted in the final calculation of Average Waiting Time for the Priority scheduling algorithm. Ensure all final calculations are double-checked.",
