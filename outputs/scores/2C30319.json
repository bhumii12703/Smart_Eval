  "evaluation_report": "## Student Evaluation Report\n\nThis is an outstanding performance demonstrating a strong grasp of foundational Operating System concepts across both modules. The answers are highly detailed, well-structured, and include specific examples and mechanisms required by the key.\n\nThe subjective answers achieved a perfect score due to the depth and accuracy of the content provided. All required diagrams were included and clearly labeled, significantly enhancing the explanations of OS services, IPC models, and multi-threading models.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   **Conceptual Mastery:** Demonstrated deep understanding of core topics, including OS services, system distinctions (Multiprocessor vs. Clustered), IPC mechanisms (Shared Memory and Message Passing), and multi-threading models.\n*   **Detailed Explanations:** Answers went beyond basic definitions, providing specific details on implementation (e.g., Naming, Synchronization, and Buffering in Message Passing; examples for threading models).\n*   **Excellent Structure:** Use of tables for distinctions (Q1b) and clear enumeration of services (Q1a) made the answers easy to follow and comprehensive.\n*   **Diagrammatic Representation:** All required diagrams (estimated at 5 for the attempted questions) were present and effectively supported the textual explanations.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n*   **Quiz Accuracy (IPC):** Review the precise definition of Inter-Process Communication (IPC). IPC refers specifically to communication between separate **processes**, not just threads within the same process.\n*   **Scheduling Algorithms:** While not attempted, ensure readiness to apply quantitative skills for CPU scheduling problems (Q4a) in future assessments.",
