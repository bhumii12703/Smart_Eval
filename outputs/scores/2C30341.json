  "evaluation_report": "## Student Evaluation Report\n\nThis report summarizes your performance on the Operating Systems Test-01. Your overall performance demonstrates a strong grasp of CPU scheduling algorithms and the fundamental differences between processes and threads. You excelled in Module 2, showing proficiency in complex calculations. Module 1 concepts were generally understood but lacked depth in certain definitions and service explanations.\n\n### Performance Summary\n\nYou demonstrated excellent application skills in the calculation-heavy section (Module 2). Your FCFS, Round Robin, and Preemptive Priority scheduling calculations were executed flawlessly, resulting in correct average waiting and turnaround times.\n\nIn Module 1, you provided solid definitions and distinctions, particularly regarding multiprocessor vs. clustered systems and the core goals of multiprogramming vs. multitasking. However, the explanation of OS services was incomplete, missing several critical functions like I/O operations and file management.\n\nYou included relevant diagrams (3 estimated) to support your answers, which aids clarity, particularly in explaining the difference between processes and threads.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   **CPU Scheduling Mastery:** You accurately calculated the Average Waiting Time and Average Turnaround Time for FCFS, Round Robin (q=2ms), and Preemptive Priority algorithms. This demonstrates strong analytical and application skills (CO2).\n*   **Process vs. Thread Distinction:** Your answer for Q4(b) was comprehensive, clearly outlining the differences in resource sharing (stack/data/code) and the lightweight nature of threads.\n*   **Conceptual Clarity:** You correctly identified the primary goals of multiprogramming (CPU utilization) and multitasking (responsiveness).\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n*   **Algorithm Selection:** For Q4(a), you calculated Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) instead of the requested Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), which is a preemptive algorithm. Ensure you differentiate between these two scheduling types.\n*   **Depth in OS Services:** Your explanation of Operating System services (Q1a) was limited to Resource Allocation and Protection/Security. You must include and explain core services like Program Execution, I/O Operations, File System Manipulation, and Communication to achieve full marks.\n*   **Quiz Fundamentals:** Review basic OS concepts, specifically the process states (Ready state definition) and fundamental Unix system calls like `fork()`.",
