The student demonstrated a foundational understanding of theoretical concepts but struggled significantly with the application and calculation aspects of CPU scheduling algorithms.\n\n### Summary of Performance\n\nThe student performed well in the Quiz section and showed solid conceptual knowledge regarding Virtual Machines and the distinction between processes and threads. However, the performance in Module 2, specifically the quantitative scheduling problem (Q4a), was weak due to errors in algorithm application and calculation methodology. In Module 1, the explanation of system call types was generally good, but the definition and explanation of certain types (like Protection) lacked precision.\n\n### Diagram Performance\n\nThe student provided a diagram for the Virtual Machine concept (Q2a), which was helpful for illustrating the abstraction layers. However, several other questions required diagrams (e.g., OS services, IPC models, multi-threading models) which were not included. Incorporating these visual aids is crucial for earning full marks in descriptive questions.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   **Conceptual Clarity (Q4b):** Excellent distinction provided between processes and threads, covering key differences like weight, resource usage, and memory space.\n*   **Virtual Machine Concept (Q2a):** Successfully captured the core idea of hardware abstraction and provided a relevant example (VMWare).\n*   **System Call Types:** Demonstrated good recall and basic understanding of most system call categories (Process Control, File Management, Device Management, Information Maintenance).\n*   **Quiz Performance:** Strong performance in the multiple-choice section, indicating good retention of fundamental definitions.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n*   **CPU Scheduling Algorithms (Q4a):** This is the most critical area for improvement.\n    *   **Methodology:** Calculations for Waiting Time and Turnaround Time consistently failed to correctly incorporate Arrival Time.\n    *   **Algorithm Application:** The student incorrectly applied non-preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) when Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) was required.\n    *   **Accuracy:** The Priority scheduling Gantt chart was fundamentally flawed, missing a significant portion of the total execution time.\n*   **Definitions and Precision:** Ensure definitions are precise. The definition of System Calls was omitted, and the explanation of the 'Protection' system call type was vague, focusing on security scanning rather than controlled resource access.\n*   **Diagram Inclusion:** Practice drawing and labeling the required diagrams for theoretical questions (e.g., OS services, IPC models) to enhance explanations and secure full marks.\n*   **Attempting All Parts:** The Round Robin scheduling calculation was not attempted, resulting in lost marks for Q4a.",
